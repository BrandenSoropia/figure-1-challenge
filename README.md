## Setup Instructions

**Requirements:**

Developed using Node `v12.13`. I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage your Node versions. (If you already have Node installed, you'll have to uninstall it first before switching to `nvm`)

```
# Installs v12.13.1
nvm install 12.13.1

# Now use that installed version!
nvm use 12.13.1
```

This project uses `Expo`, [please follow their setup instructions here](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/). Ignore the setup instructions for iOS/Android emulators if you don't want to use it, you can test it directly on your phone by downloading the Expo client app: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/expo-client/id982107779) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_CA). (These work only if you're computer and phone are on the same wifi AFAIK.)

> Note that it's recommended to install [Watchmen](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install/#buildinstall) too if you're using macOS.

I'm also using [Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

**How to Run Locally:**

1. Clone this repo and navigate to its directory in terminal
2. Build/serve app by running `yarn start`. An Expo dashboard will open in your browser.
3. In the dashboard's left panel, you can choose to run the app on the browser or, if setup, Expo's mobile simulators. If you installed the Expo client app to your phone, you can scan the QR code and run it directly to your device.

All tests can be run via `yarn test`.

**Running React Native Dev Tools:**
You can use React Dev tools (run on your computer, not browser!) to inspect elements. You will need to do the following:

1. Install dev tools globally by running `npm install -g react-devtools@^3` in terminal. It needs version 3 since [Expo37 is running React Native 0.61](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/), and [devtools 4 needs 0.62+](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools).
2. Run app in a simulator (not Expo client!).
3. Start dev tools by running `react-devtools` in your terminal.
4. Trigger "shake" gesture in simulator. For iOS, that's done by pressing `Cmd + Control + Z` or `Device > Shake`. Click "Reload" and it should be connected!
5. You might have to re "shake" and click "Show Element Inspector" to actually inspect elements.

**View UI Library Via Storybook:**

You can look directly at the isolated components used to make this app using Storybook in-app!

1. Run app on simulator or your phone using the above mentioned instructions.
2. Click on the bug icon on the top bar (üêû) to toggle showing Storybook or the app!

**To Develop With Storybook:**
It's a little funky since React Native can't use dynamic imports to automatically find all stories. I've set it up to use a script to auto-generate a `storyLoader.js` file that'll have find all stories in `src/` folder every time you run `yarn prestorybook`. (this will run when `yarn storybook` is called too)

It's super sketchy, I think, but does the job for now! Refresh the app on your phone/simulator and it should have the latest stories!

## Things I Wanted to Do But Time-Capped This

1. Test navigating from post to post details and back via React testing library (ran out of time...)
2. Re-fetch feed/post data to make sure that when a user clicks a post to view its details, it'd have the most up-to-date version.
3. Figure out why the feed won't fully scroll down!
4. Define a theme for easier styling consistency
5. Separate common components into primitives (`Body` and `Heading` only atm), and "compound components" (`UserDetails`)

## Why I Used Certain Technologies

_Storybook_

I like to develop the UI in pieces. Storybook helps me do that by allowing a isolated playground per component. A bonus is that I can also define the props I think I need at the same time.

A testing bonus is that it helps me think of each scenario this each component might have (ex: empty state, missing some info state, fully populated state etc.). I'm able to see what each state would look like.

_i18n_

If I needed to localize, it'd be easier to have this setup in the beginning before hunting down each hard-coded string. Not super helpful in this challenge, it's a force of habit and wanted to learn how to set it up on React Native!
